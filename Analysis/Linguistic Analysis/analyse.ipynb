          "The blue car could have moved into the right lane prior to exiting, which would mean that it did not have to wait for an opening to quickly exit on the ramp.",

          "It could not go around the van because there was a car coming in the opposite direction.",
          "It wanted to be clear of any obstacles in front of it.",
          "It took these actions because its goal was to leave the highway on the off-ramp to be able to do that it had to go to the right.",
          "The blue car could have waited for the other cars to make their own decisions before it turned right.",
          "It was being overly cautious.",

          "If the blue car had applied the brakes so that the shipping truck had gone ahead much quicker, it could have switched lanes much sooner, first to the lane that the truck had been in, and then switched to the off-ramp. Much smoother lane changes are ideal as opposed to barreling through two in one go.",
          "Because the other car was in the turning exit lane.",
          "It could have waited until it was clear and then proceeded forward",
          "The action of the blue car was bad , since the blue car need to wait for the white car to curve, but rather the blue car curve first which was bad driving.",
          "Reduce the chances of an accident from occuring",
          "The blue self-driving car was influenced by the curve in the road making it reduce its speed.",

          "It was trained to yield to other traffic so that it would drive safely.",
          "The blue car intended on driving a straight path but hit an obstacle. the blue car slowed down, waiting for the obstacle to clear. The blue car continued on its intended path.",
          "it took these actions because it needs to slow down on turns and look for people who are crossing",
          "The blue car was in the straight or turn right lane and a white car pulled over in front of it to turn right. The blue car then moved to the left lane that was straight only to continue down the road.",

          "The blue car saw the white car and did not want to collide with it. So it waited for the white car to come out of the circle before it started again.",
          "The car saw a chance to exit and took it.",
          "It took those actions in order to make its route easier",
          "The action of the blue car was wrong since he needed to be on the outer lane before making a curve as the arrows indicated.",
          "The blue car came out of what appeared have pulled over to  parking lane and went around two parked cars.  The blue car allowed another car that was going the wrong direction to pass before pulling out of the parking lane",

          "The blue car could have accelerated and overtook the truck and then immediately could have turned right. This would have cut off the truck and might have resulted in an accident.",
          "It was affected by the road markings and the cars crossing",
          "The car was influenced by the fact it had to exit in a short manner of time.",

          "The blue self-driving car could have continued at its current speed through the curve potentially causing an accident.",
          "The blue car waits behind the white line in front of the round about, making sure all incoming cars have passed its vicinity before proceeding to slowly enter the round about itself. After doing so, the blue car goes around the round about before carefully exiting to the right of its destination.",
          "It was passing the car that was in the rear of the 2 cars in the slow lane. At this time, it estimated that if it was going to reach the exit in time, it would have to pass that car, but didn't have enough time to pass the other, so it merged in between them before merging into the exit lane.",
          "The car likely slows down to maintain control, also to provide comfortable ride to the passengers of the car.",
          "Since there were cars parked on both sides of the street, neither direction had the legal right of way. They needed to cooperate with drivers in the other direction.",
          "the blue car sees a ball and predicts a child",
          "The car handled a corner quite well, braking and passing at a correct speed.",
          "The blue car slowed as it approached the turn and then accelerated once the roadway straightened out again.",
          "It was trained to know when a car in front of it was slowing. It also wanted to complete the goal. I was trained to be impatient since it didn't wait for the car to move out of its way.",
          "The blue car was going to enter the fast highway and I waited for a vehicle that was coming to move forward and then the blue car entered",
          "it was really the only choice other than going straight at the corner.  it took these actions because of the computer programming and GPS.",
          "The blue car was coming from the fast lane and needed to go to an intersection and had to wait for one of the cars to rent so he could cross and move forward.",
          "It was influenced by the rules of the road and slowing down for possible cases where pedestrians might be.",
          "It could have gone as soon as there was a spot open for saving time.",
          "The blue car was influenced to take these actions because of the white car next to it, which was an obstacle in its way when trying to access the off-ramp exit.",
          "It was just following standard traffic rules",
          "The blue car could have tried to pass the truck, which would have caused a collision with the opposing white car.",
          "The blue car was following programmed directions and did not seem to be influenced by the scenario.",
          "The blue car wanted to gauge what the white car was doing before it proceeded, in order not to cause a collision with the white car.",
          "The blue car observed the oncoming car, yielded, and then entered",
          "It didn't have to stop because of the speed of the hwy car, but it did have to slow. Legally it is required to wait for the highway car to pass.",

          "The blue car could continue moving without slowing impacting the child. It also could come to a complete stop as opposed to just slowing down.",
          "The car chose these actions because it did not want to hit the pedestrian and cause serious harm. Any other type of action would most likely resulted in a negative outcome. The car chose the best action that a person driving the car would most likely have chosen.",
          "It would've hit the people otherwise.",
          "It was programmed to take a certain route and followed the rules of the road to accomplish its task.",

          "The blue car waited with the van in front of it to allow a car to pass through the narrow lane.  it then cautiously moved forward and made a right turn.",
          "It's actions had to take the other drivers on the road into account",
          "A desire not to kill.",

          "It sped up to get in front of the car next to it so that it could get to the exit faster.",
          "Turned right into oncoming traffic",
          "The blue self-driving car predicted the white car would continue in its current lane and simulated that there could be a collision if it continued onto the highway at its current speed.  It determined that it was safer to yield to the white car.",
          "The car has speed sensors that allowed it to slow when it needed to for it to safely continue on its path.",

          "Other vehicles were driving which forced the blue car to wait to enter the roadway.",
          "Was influenced by the speed of the vehicles ahead of it, and took the safer option of slowing down behind them.",
          "It just followed the directions",
          "The street was narrow, there were parked cars on either side that it had to predict would either move or not, there was a truck ahead of it, and there was another car turning onto that narrow street.",

          "It was influenced with the road marking and the pedestrians crossing",

          "It could have waited longer just to ensure that the car was actually turning left. If it wasn't, it would have been a serious accident.",

          "The blue car, which was in the far left lane, slowed down to allow itself to be able to cross lanes of traffic to reach the exit.",
          "I think the action could be described as somewhat evasive as the last car in the lineup was protruding slightly into the roadway.",
          "It knows to yield when entering oncoming traffic.",
          "Cuts across two lanes to get to the off ramp.",

          "The blue car continued forward on the road along its path turning slowly at he bend along the road.",
          "The blue car is programmed with sensors to avoid collisions.",
          "The blue car had  to move to the side because the road of narrow and only one car could pass at a time and there wasn't room for the white car going in the opposite direction to move over. Then the blue car started to proceed with the van in front but pulled back over to ensure no one was coming in the opposite direction and then moved forward to turn right at the next road.",
          "The blue car had to follow the road signs and it needed to wait for the white car to go straight or turn left in order to avoid an accident.",
          "The blue car did so as it seems to be the best course of action. Slowing down allows for quicker response time such as stopping the car to prevent a collision, and the blue car stopping completely would not resolve the situation.",
          "It slowed down and then went on the highway when it was safe.",
          "Because the car cut it off",
          "The blue car waited to see how the traffic was going to act before proceeding on course.",
          "If the blue car didn't check for other cars, the driver would be at risk of colliding with another vehicle.",

          "The car was following the law and keeping people safe.",
          "It was influenced by the actions of the truck. If the truck had behaved differently the car would have something different.",
          "Another car pulled out in front of it.",
          "To be cautious with the lane becoming narrow",
          "The other cars were to the left of the car. Unless the car drove off-road through the grass, it had to go that route.",
          "It took these actions because it did not want to get into an accident with the other cars and wanted to use the correct lanes for exiting when it needed to.",
          "The blue car was patient and was able to make its desired turn.",
          "The blue car took an UNSAFE movement between two other moving cars on its right in order to go even more to the right for the exit. It's hard to tell that it sensed the car behind it slowing or not as it accelerated while in the left lane.",
          "The cars influenced the length of the stop. The exit he wanted to go to influenced the need to move into the left lane.",
          "Blue car got cut off by the car in the other lane that needed to turn. Blue car was going straight so they just got into the other lane and passed the other car to proceed.",
          "Its actions would have changed if it had arrived at the intersections last, or if the other car wasn't there.",
          "Sensors noticed the traffic ahead and led the blue car to yield to the white car before entering the road from the on ramp.",
          "The blue car took these actions to avoid a collision with the white car that was backing out of its parking spot.",
          "It is the best action since it waited for the pedestrians",
          "The blue car travels  behind the van, When the van crosses the junction, the blue car pulls around the parked car and then drives forward and turns right at the junction.",
          "It stopped and waited for all other cars to be clear before going.",
          "The blue was influenced by the oncoming curve in the road to slow down its speed immensely.",
          "A new course of action would be that it just kept going at the same speed as it approached the corner that's just driving straight off the road or taking the corner at the same speed and probably rolling the car",
          "Because people were crossing",
          "It was looking out for the safety of the child.",

          "The blue car slows down to get behind the truck since they needed to get all the way over in order to turn",
          "it sensed the car pulling out and slowed down giving them time to pull out of the spot before proceeding",

          "It did accomplish its goal to turn left and land behind the waiting cars.",
          "It was probably in a hurry and/or not paying attention.",
          "A different action would be to continue straight without stopping, thus hitting the boy or swerve and potentially hit another vehicle possibly on coming or parked",
          "The car seemed to wait at the stop to allow for a clear path to its goal. This was done for safety reasons.",
          "So they would not be slowed down on their journey",
          "The blue car driver wanted to get on to the highway safely",
          "The blue car was influenced by the truck ahead of it and therefore, slowed down to wait.",
          "The vehicle had stopped so other vehicles could make a turn.",
          "Different parameters might result in a death here.",
          "It exited the highway through the off-ramp.",
          "The blue car could miss the first exit, and have to go all the way around in order to come back to the road that it needs to take",
          "Better tuning could let it get behind the second car and more safely get on the off-ramp.",
          "If the pedestrians weren't there it could've just turned right and kept going",
          "If the truck were to go slower then the blue car can pull up and bypass it",
          "The blue car could have waited for the car to take the left turn before committing its right turn",
          "Adding a turn from the on ramp to allow the car to go down a different path.",
          "The blue car saw that the exit they wanted to take was approaching and did not see an opening ahead of the vehicle in front of them, so the blue car slowed down and went behind the traffic",
          "Slowing to stop at the first stop sign. 'Seeing' car action from the right and the left. Staying stopped while car from left drives through intersection. It then turned in front of a car on the right that did not have a stop sign but for some reason was stopped. It slowed as to not hit the car in front of it. It, and all the other cars, proceeded to drive through another stop sign and intersection.",
          "He was trying to get to his destination.",
          "The car had to wait for clear traffic, and then apparently was able to tell the car on the main road had stopped to turn, which allowed for the blue car to turn right in this moment.",
          "They knew that that they would no have been able to make it if they tried.",
          "It was the desired route",
          "It was influenced by the people crossing the road in front of it.",
          "If there had been traffic coming the opposite direction of the blue car then there would have been a collision because of the inpatients of the blue car.",
          "It was influenced because of the long truck in front of it.",
          "The blue car was forced to change lanes because the white car got in front of it.",
          "The car took these actions because even though it was tasked with following the road, it was programmed to stop for pedestrians.",
          "The blue car approached the highway and then paused briefly to allow another car to go by before entering the highway.",
          "it didnt want to slide off the road",
          "Because it does not know if the car is going to turn or not.",
          "After turning right, the car paused at a pedestrian intersection to allow people to cross.",
          "Possibly to wait in case of further oncoming cars coming through the congested street.",
          "Could have just waited.",
          "It waited behind the car in front of it for a while before suddenly overtaking it and continuing on while the car tried to park.",
          "If there was another car coming in left lane then the blue car might not be able to change",
          "It would have run over the person if it hadn't.",
          "The blue car should have just waited for the car that was trying to park instead of making a potentially unsafe decision to go around it.",
          "The blue car slows their speed so that they can get into the right lane to exit the highway.",
          "Having to maintain current speed was the logical choice.",
          "It would be influenced by the traffic and the road conditions at the time it was trying to meet its goal",
          "To continue his route and for this he had to pass to the vehicle in front of him.",
          "When it was time to go back into the right lane, another car could have been pulling out, or driving along the right lane. The blue car would have had to decide whether to speed up then move into the right lane, or keep driving in the left lane.   A car could have come from the opposing direction in the left lane. The blue car would have been screwed, or need to gun it back into the right lane.",
          "There were other vehicles present so the blue car couldn't get in the exit lane sooner.",
          "The blue car is driving in the over taking lane on the right hand side. It is moving parallel to a white car beside it as well as the blue car being behind another white car in the opposing lane in front of it. As it was overtaking the white car next to it, it proceeds to quickly speed up before quickly cutting across the lanes in front of the white car that was next to it before cutting over to the next lane to exit off the highway down an off-ramp.",
          "It yielded to the oncoming traffic",
          "The blue car was going to enter another lane and waited for another vehicle to pass to enter, then it moved forward to continue its route.",
          "If it was noted that there were parked cars perhaps this would have allowed the programming to function quicker.",
          "If it didn't slow down on the turn it would have crashed into the white car.",
          "Came upon a traffic circle, waited for cross traffic to pass & for their turn to enter, made the circuit & exited where desired",
          "The blue car was blocked by a shipping truck for most of the time and had to aggressively cross two lanes in order to reach the off-ramp.",
          "It followed street laws.",
          "The blue car watched the speed of the oncoming white car, and made a decision to enter the roadway before the car reached the entry point.",
          "The car took these actions because speeding up would have been a dangerous way to take the exit.",
          "The car drove ahead, and slowed to a stop when the white car started to back out of its parking spot. The blue car waited until the white car was backed out and driving away before continuing straight behind it.",
          "The blue car could have increased its speed and not waited for the pedestrians but it could have resulted in an accident",
          "It had to stop to allow the other driver to go",
          "The blue self-driving car was influenced by the ball in the road and then the person crossing the road.",

          "Safety, to not cause an accident",
          "The car could have just kept going maybe hitting the people walking.",

          "Its movement was influenced by the moving truck.",
          "The blue car moved over when the other car pulled in front of it to make the right turn.",
          "Driving on a straightaway, came to a switchback, slowed, made the turn & then continued on their way",
          "If the person wasn't there, it would have just driven straight through. If it hadn't been trained well enough it might have run the person over to get to its goal.",
          "That was the only option the blue car had in order to avoid an accident that was and would have not been the blue car fault.",
          "It was influenced to slow down due to people.",
          "Its sensors detected the other car and it knew it had to let the car go past before entering the highway.",
          "It should have waited a little while for the moving car from his left to progress first",
          "It probably assessed how the truck is a big vehicle and how it is dangerous to make sudden movements beside it.",
          "The blue car could have sped up to get in front of the oncoming hwy car. It would have been an awkward turn for sure. Or the highway car could have slowed down, or moved into the left land, in which case the blue car could have entered the hwy.",
          "It saw a chance to exit the road even if it meant cutting a car off.",

The boy runs out in front of the blue self driving car and across the street chasing a soccer ball and runs across the road without looking or stopping. The blue self driving car slows to a stop to avoid hitting the boy and then continues on its way.",

          "The blue self driving car had to turn right at the junction. Before that the car had to navigate through a small traffic jam where on street parking led to there being only one lane useable with cars in both directions.  The car slowed down, waited for an opening, and then eventually made the right turn.  In some instances the car seemed more sluggish compared to human response.",
          "The car was going slower because it may be harder for a self driving car to determine whether a car is parked or moving compared to a human.  This causes the car to have to go slower in tighter spaces.",
          "The self driving car took these actions to avoid an accident.",
          "The other driver changed lanes in front of it and thus indicated it wished to turn at the junction, inducing the self-driving car to go around it to continue unimpeded.",
          "If the other car had slowed down or sped up, it would have either sped up or remained at the same rate of speed in order to merge with traffic. If the other car would have merged into the left lane, the self driving car would have just maintained it's speed while merging.",

The speed limit would also have to be higher for the self-driving car to be able to pick up enough speed to pass the semi.",

          "The space between the 2 cars in the slow lane was enough that the self driving car could merge in between and then still have enough time to merge into the exit lane.",
          "The self driving car took these actions so it could finish the task of reaching the end of the road.  I suppose it changed lanes to accomplish the task quicker.",
          "The car approached an intersection and stopped. There was another car at the intersection perpendicular and to the right of the self-driving car that was stopped there. After that, the blue self driving car took the right of way and made a left turn on to a roadway where it stopped behind 2 other cars. After the 2 other cars had cleared the intersection the blue self driving car went straight through the intersection.",
          "The self driving car slightly pulled out around another car as the other car pulled into a parking spot on the right",
          "The blue self-driving car continues straight on the road until it determines there is something in the road and then stops until it can continue.",
          "The blue self-driving car slows down to let both cars pass and then merges over into the other lane and onto the highway exit ramp.",
          "The other car at the first intersection could have gone first, so that the self-driving car would have waited for the traffic to clear, and most likely the self driving car would have followed that car. Also, if the other cars weren't stopped at the second intersection, the self driving car would not have stopped either.",
          "The blue self-driving car moved down one side of a narrow street with parked cars, behind a truck doing the same. When another car turned onto that narrow street, the self-driving car pulled over into the parking spaces with the truck to allow the other car to go by. Afterwards, it waited for the truck to go through the junction before picking up speed and turning right at the junction.",
          "The blue self-driving car took these actions over different actions to reach its destination faster. Passing the car rather than waiting saved them some time.",
          "The blue self-driving car slows down and then merges over into the other lane to pass a car that is parking.",
          "The blue self-driving car took these actions to get off the highway and reach its destination based on prior predictions of previous rides.",
          "The self driving car slowed down into a parking lane, as to allow other cars to back out.",
          "The blue self-driving car seems to be cautious when passing along others who may not see them and let a car pulling out proceed to do so as to not get hit.",
          "The blue self driving car had slowed down and waited for the vehicle to turn before it made it's own turn.",
          "The actions of the blue self driving car were from a stop it pulled out left onto the road behind the line of waiting cars which then those cars proceeded to go straight and as did the blue self having car",
          "The self driving car was traveling on a road, where there were people walking across between parked cars. When it sensed the presence of a person, it slowed down to a near stop to the person cross.",
          "The other driver would have to wait for the self-driving car to pass before pulling out of the parking space in order for the self-driving car to drive uninterrupted down its road. If any other driver also pulled out of their parking space, the self-driver car would have to stop more times and take longer to proceed down the road.",
          "The blue self-driving car was influenced by the white car turning into a parking space which interrupted its goal of continuing straight.",
          "The car at the first intersection wasn't moving, so the self-driving car took the right of way. The cars at the second intersection were stopped which caused the self-driving car to stop as well.",
          "The blue self driving car was influenced to take these actions because of the vehicle coming out of it's parking space.",
          "The self driving car slowed down as soon as it saw the white car pulling out. This was appropriate.",
          "The self driving car was influenced by noticing that there was a cross walk.  It caused the car to stop.",
          "If either of the 2 cars in the slow lane were to speed up or slow down the self-driving car would have to speed up to go past both of them or slow down to get in behind the last car. If the car to the rear in the slow lane would have sped up or even passed the car in front, the self-driving car could also have gotten in behind them.",
          "The blue self-driving car chose the base route based on directions provided for the route. This was probably the safest and fastest route which the blue self-driving car knew about based on prior routes.",
          "Per instructions the blue self-driving car was influenced on prior trips. Additionally, the car made predictions based on safety measures provided by instructions from the GPS when the final destination was input into the GPS.",
          "The other driver pulling out of the parking place forced the self-driving car to stop rather than continue onwards unimpeded.",
          "The self driving car drove straight, behind the white car, until the white car began to park. The self driving car, then pulled into the other lane to maintain it's speed and go around the white car. The self driving car then continued driving straight.",
          "The self-driving car may not have known how long the turning lane was and had to cut off the second car in order to make the exit in time.",
          "The blue self-driving car was influenced in this scenario based on prior driving patterns. It could have seen other cars speeding rather than slowing down to exit the highway.",
          "The self driving car slowed as it came to the end",
          "The blue self-driving car cut in between two cars and across two lanes to get off at the exit ramp it needed to.",
          "The blue self-driving car was proceeding along its road when a driver in the other lane changed lanes in front of them. The blue self-driving car then changed to the opposite lane and continued to the end of its road while the other driver turned onto another street.",
          "The self driving car was driving behind another car that slowed down almost to a complete stop to park. The self driving car went around the other car.",

          "The blue car waited until both the white car already in the roundabout and the white car to its left waiting to enter the roundabout had passed before entering the roundabout.",
          "It's because the self-driving car could observe the other driver's speed and potentially even turn signals to calculate they wished to exit the roundabout rather than continue ahead, leaving it acceptable and safe for the car to pull out in front of it. Also the lane the other driver was traveling in.",
          "The blue self-driving car remained stopped until both cars went. Then the blue car proceeded to the roundabout and took the second exit.",

          "The blue car comes to a full stop, allows both cars to enter roundabout and pass, then he enters at the left lane, and turns right to exit the roundabout.",

          "The blue car entered the roundabout and got off at the first exit.",
          "As the self driving car approached the exit ramp it veered right into the exit lane to be able to take the exit. When it did this it pulled in between two vehicles that kept going on the interstate.",
          "The self driving car did not enter the roundabout immediately because there was in car in the roundabout already that was too close. Once that car passed, there was a second car that entered the roundabout that at that time was too close, so the self driving car had to remain stopped until both cars were safely out of range.",
          "The blue car recognized that there were two vehicles trying to enter the roundabout and therefore waited for both vehicles to go through the roundabout",
          "If the self driving car were to enter the roundabout when the first car was approaching there may have been a collision. Same was true for the second car.",
          "The blue car entered the roundabout after the second white car.  The blue car then turned right at the second exit.",
          "The car in the roundabout has the right of way. So first the blue car waited until the white car in the roundabout passed. The white car to the left of the blue car was already waiting at the stop sign, and also has the right of way after the car already in the roundabout (it could enter sooner), so the blue car waited for that car to pass as well before entering the roundabout.",
          "The blue self-driving car could have determined that there was time to enter the roundabout without yielding to the white car, potentially causing a collision.",
          "The blue car waited on the first white car to pass then the 2nd white car that entered the road. Finally it went and changed lanes at the moment it needed to exit the roundabout",

          "It waited its turn to enter and exit the roundabout",
          "The blue car yielded, then entered the roundabout, exiting at the first option.",
          "After coming to a stop on the road it was on and waiting for two vehicles to go by the self driving vehicle pulled out onto the roundabout and left it on the 2nd exit",
          "It sensed a car driving around the roundabout, another one that came after that, then 'saw' the road was clear for it to turn. The goal was to exit the 2nd exit from its start spot so it had to move right to turn right.",
          "It could have turned right before the first car came around the roundabout.",
          "The blue car waited for its turn in the roundabout. Then when it was safe to go, it entered the roundabout, followed its lane, then made the second exist.",
          "The blue self driving car was influenced to take these actions as it was approaching a roundabout.",
          "The blue car waited for the white cars to pass before entering the roundabout. Once it entered, the blue car exited at the second exit.",

          "The white car slowed down causing the blue car to react",
          "The blue car could have not switched lanes and could have stayed in the lane behind the white car. The blue car would have had to wait until the white car turned before it could have continued down its path.",

          "The blue car could have sped up in order to beat the white car",

          "The blue car didn't want to get into an accident with the white car, as this would have prevented it from completing its mission to drive straight on the road it was on.",
          "It was influenced by the amount of time it takes to park, the blue car did not want to wait long so it goes around the white car.",
          "The blue car probably should have waited for the white car to finish parking so that it didn't have to swerve around and enter the other lane.",
          "The stopped white car prompted the blue car to go.",
          "The blue car cut off the 2nd white car to make an unsafe exit.",
