# Project on Autonomous Vehicle Explanations

This is a repo for working analysis by second and third authors. The project has another site and readme explaining the data collected by the first author, Balint Gyevnar.

## Authors

- Balint Gyevnar (likely to not work in this repo much)
- Stephanie Droop (stephanie.droop@ed.ac.uk)
- Tadeg Quillien

## Packages needed for analysis in R

- tidyverse

## License

License is with CC 4 - but how?

## Notes

- MON 12 FEB - new file `HighlightAV.R` lmer finds no difference in ppts' propensity to cite beliefs, desires and intentions of blue car between thinking the blue car is an AV or has a human driver. So, intentional stance is a useful fiction, albeit one we knew all along (how likely we are to say 'my bluetooth is in a huff', 'my laptop isn't talking to the printer') but good to have empirical backup, may help design of AVs.
- File structure likely to change as we get the project off the ground (Feb 2024).

## Folders

- Dataset (from Balint) -- This too big and it hangs. So need to separately put the data we need
- Analysis (subsequent work)
