# Project on Autonomous Vehicle Explanations

This is a repo for working analysis by second and third authors. The project has another site and readme explaining the data collected by the first author, Balint Gyevnar.

## Authors

- Balint Gyevnar (likely to not work in this repo much)
- Stephanie Droop (stephanie.droop@ed.ac.uk)
- Tadeg Quillien

## Packages needed for analysis in R

- tidyverse

## License

License is with CC 4 - but how?

## Notes

- File structure likely to change as we get the project off the ground (Feb 2024).

## Folders

- Dataset (from Balint) -- This too big and it hangs. So need to separately put the data we need
- Analysis (subsequent work)
